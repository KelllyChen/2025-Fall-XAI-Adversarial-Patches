# 2025-Fall-XAI-Adversarial-Patches
This assignment aims to create an adversarial patch to fool the Torchvision ResNet34 model trained on a small version of ImageNet.

**What’s in the repo:** a notebook and an images/ folder.

**What’s in images/:** the image used to create the patch (teddy.jpg) and the creative disguise (the final, disguised patch).

**Patch details:** the patch is black & white and hidden inside a “lost dog” notice image to disguise it in a printable flyer.
